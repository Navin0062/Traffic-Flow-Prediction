# Traffic Flow Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting traffic flow patterns using machine learning techniques. The system analyzes historical traffic data to forecast future traffic conditions, which can be valuable for urban planning and traffic management.

## Features
- Traffic flow prediction using machine learning models
- Data visualization capabilities
- Historical data analysis
- Real-time traffic forecasting (if implemented)

## Requirements
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages 

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Navin0062/Traffic-Flow-Prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Traffic-Flow-Prediction
   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Traffic_Flow_Prediction.ipynb
   ```
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to:
   - Load and preprocess data
   - Train the prediction model
   - Evaluate model performance
   - Make predictions
